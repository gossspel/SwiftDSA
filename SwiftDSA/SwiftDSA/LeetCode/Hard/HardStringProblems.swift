// MARK: - 32. Longest Valid Parentheses
// LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-valid-parentheses/
//
// Description: Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', find the length of the longest valid
// (well-formed) parentheses substring.
//
// Strategy: Use three vars openCount, closeCount, and longestStreak, loop through the string, if the char is '(',
// increment the openCount, else if char is ')', increment the closeCount. When we increment the closeCount, if
// closeCount == openCount, we would have balanced parentheses, so we should update the longestStreak if openCount +
// closeCount > longestStreak. If closeCount > openCount, we would have a lone close paranthesis that happens before
// any lone open parathesis, so we would have to reset openCount and closeCount to zero to try to fish for the next
// longestStreak if there is any. This left scanning approach is good for most cases beside "()((())", in which the
// longestStreak would be 2, which is in correct. Luckily, we can perform a similar right scanning approach to make
// this algorithm complete. Return longestStreak after the left and right scanning.
